/* Your goal is to print Dennis Ritchie's famous quote to the screen just as shown below. 
To make this task a bit harder, you are only allowed to use one printf statement in your entire program. 
Be sure not to omit anything and not to print anything extra.*/

#include <stdio.h>

    printf("Dennis Ritchie said: \n \"The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it.\"");
